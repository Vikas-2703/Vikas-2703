## 👋 About Me

I am a Data & Business Intelligence Analyst who enjoys turning raw, messy data into insights that business teams can actually use.  
My experience spans **dashboarding, analytics, and cloud data engineering** – from cleaning and modelling data in SQL/Python to building modern data pipelines on **AWS** and visualising results in **Power BI / Tableau / R Shiny**.

I’m especially interested in:

- Building **end-to-end analytics solutions** – ingestion → modelling → dashboards  
- Designing **data lakes / ETL pipelines** on cloud (AWS S3, Glue, Lambda, Athena)  
- Creating **interactive dashboards** that answer real business questions and tell a clear story  

I enjoy collaborating with stakeholders, asking “**what decision will this chart actually drive?**”, and then designing the data model and visuals around that.
